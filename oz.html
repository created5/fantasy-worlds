        <h3>Geography</h3>
        <p>Oz is the largest nation on its continent, located in the Nonestic Ocean. It is rectangular in shape, and divided into four smaller regions, one on each side with regional borders at the diagonals, and the Emerald City, from where Queen Ozma rules, in the center. The four regions each have their own color motif, as seen on the map (below, left) and flag (below, right)<br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Map-of-Oz.jpg/400px-Map-of-Oz.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Oz_flag.svg/1280px-Oz_flag.svg.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image"><br>Oz is cut off from the rest of Earth topographically by the Deadly Desert, which supposedly turns any who touch it to sand, and by a magic barrier, rendering the land invisible.</p>
        <h3>Politics and Economy</h3>
        <p>Politically, Oz is a federal monarchy much like the German Empire. Queen Ozma rules the nation overall, but the four regions each have their own individual rulers. The regional leaders do have grander titles than their political power would suggest, but this is done just to humor them.<br><br>Economically, Oz has no concept of money. This led to complications in at least one book, where a citizen of Oz gets in trouble in the neighboring land of Ev because of his unfamiliarity with the concept of money.</p>
