            <li>Population: N/A</li>

        <h3>Exogeology</h3>
        <p>Discworld, the eponymous land of Terry Pratchett's novels, is a flat disc (with obligatory waterfalls at the tropical Rim) carried by four elephants, who in turn are carried by the Giant Star Turtle, Great A'Tuin.
        Not much is known about Great A'Tuin, other than its name, that it carries the elephants who carry the Disc, and that it looks forward to something.
        <br><br>
        The Disc is mostly flat, save for Cori Celesti, the mountain in the center where the gods live (and the origin of the Disc's magic field - more on that later), and the surrounding mountain range, the Hub.
        Between the Rim and the Hub lie the four continents where much of the books take place and many islands and archipelagos. This world has many fictional substances, such as slood, an important part of human psychology, and octiron, the element which makes up most of the Disc's crust.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Magic</h3>
        <p>Magic in Discworld operates eerily similar to real natural forces, such as friction and momentum. Within Discworld's magic field, real physics are muffled, and according to the Law of Conservation of Reality, magic solutions take as much effort as their mundane counterparts. Furthermore, the Disc's magic number is neither seven nor three; instead, it is eight.
        <br><br>
        In addition, Discworld's entire existence is based on the Law of Narrative Causality, which states if a story is told and believed often enough, it is true. This, combined with magic also running on willpower, is so frustrating to the Auditors of Reality, the anthropomorphic personifications of the laws of reality, they hate the Disc and its various races with a burning passion.</p>
